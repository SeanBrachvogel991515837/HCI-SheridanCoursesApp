# HCI-SheridanCoursesApp
This program is a Sheridan courses app. A model for an application that allows users to login to keep track of their courses as an alternative to slate. 

Top 5 desirable functionality(not implemented) would be 

Maybe a linked functionality meaning when you do an assignment the content that is related to the assignment will be outlined on another page.

Another one could be a live chat room with professors for each corresponding course so you could get responses quick without having to send formal emails

Another idea could be being able to edit assignments after theâ€™ve been submitted if applicable

Having a upon startup help, a screen that tours the user having them do functionality and learn as they go

Smoothness of being able to continue where one may have left off right recents or a popup that lets one continue.
